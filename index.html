                            <div>My first professional experience was at Klik2learn, a company making software for teaching English. <br><br> I still remember that exciting feeling when I first fixed a bug in the largest program I had worked with so far- Journey2English.
                                I then participated in the design of the infrastructure for their new course- Journey2BasicSkills. It was very rewarding to see that my design decisions helped future developers develop the course more smoothly.<br><br>                                After returning to Klik2learn from my placement at CERN, I have worked on a group chat and data reporting/visualising features of Klik2learn's new Digital Learning Hub.
                                <br><br> Klik2learn is where I have grown most as a developer. I got exposure to a large codebase and a variety of web technologies, while working on challenging and interesting projects. I felt that a lot depended on me
                                and I enjoyed the impact I had on the product.

                                <div>It is still difficult for me to realise that I was writing software for protecting the largest magnets in the world that accelerate the particles in the tunnel of LHC.
                                    <br><br> I worked on a data link for magnet protection devices. I designed and implemented a protocol for effective and faultless communication between device nodes, investigated libraries for radiationproof Ethernet
                                    communication, wrote controls software and an application for testing microcontrollers.
                                    <br><br> The year I spent at CERN was one of the best in my life. Not only did I experience work at a renowned research institute but I also socialised with an amazing international community of scientists and engineers,
                                    travelled, did skiing and learnt French.
